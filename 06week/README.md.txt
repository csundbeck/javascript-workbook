There should be a Class that can be referenced to create objects: Player
There are two arrays: one to represent the redTeam, and one to represent the blueTeam
A list of people already exists with 7 people Objects created.


The properties for Player should be: canThrowBall, canDodgeBall, hasPaid, isHealthy, and yearsExperience
Player should also include a method that pushes the player to the appropriate array (redTeam or blueTeam)

When the player is selected to join a team, the buttons for each team should be disbled so that that player cannot be added to multiple teams
